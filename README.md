# Simon's Ocean

**While you were on vacation, Simon hypnotized everyone in the sea into doing whatever he says. He didn't stop there - he hypnotized the sea itself into losing all of its color. Your best friend, Crabby McStabby, has gone missing. You must build a bridge across the reef to find Crabby! The only way to break the spell and get past Simon's army is to beat him at his own game, so pay attention!**
